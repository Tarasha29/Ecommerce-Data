Ecommerce-Data
Business Data Management project: use business requirements to create tables, insert, and analyse data to formulate business insights.

There are two files of code: one is to create tables and insert data while the other is to analyze the data and extract useful information.

Aim of the project: 
1. Understand the different data points collected by an ecommerce platform. 
2. Use business requirements to create and analyse the dataset.
3. Create entity relationship diagram as well as logical design diagram 
4. Create tables and insert data 
5. Use SQL queries to find insights into the company 
6. Use insights for business plans and strategies 

Queries: 

1. Find the top and bottom selling products. Found 2 each. The top selling products should be ordered more by the company to increase inventory. The company should reconsider ordering the lowest selling products as it may not be profitable

2. Find warehouses that do the most shipments and check number of employees each. This makes sure that there is an efficient allocation of employees. On running the query, it is found that warehouses with most shipments do have most number of employees. Hence, there is no need for reallocation.

3. Find which customer service employee interacts with most customers. This will help determine top employees who can get certain rewards. Here, Ryan (who is found to be the top employee) should be given a bonus or considered for promotions. This will also incentivize other employees to work harder.

4. Calculate customer lifetime value: how much revenue the customer has generated in their lifetime. To do this, aggregate total revenue generated by each customer and find top customers. These customers can be given some discounts to show appreciation and increase customer retention 

5. Find which month has the most sales. This will identify consumer spending habits and help form strategies for discounts and deals. December already has high sales probably due to the holidays. More deals can be offered in July to boost sales. 



These conclusions are drawn by obtaining useful informtation from the data using SQL queries.
